# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

A <a href="#" target="_blank">link</a>

##### Terminal
{% highlight Bash %}
A terminal command
{% endhighlight %}

##### some html
```html
<div class="container py5">
  <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</div>
```

##### some javascript
```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
  console.log('hello');
});
```

Some inline code: `Console.WriteLine()` and a lot more text so that it moves onto the next line. This is good, because it also doubles as a longer paragraph; or at least one with multiple lines. More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines! More lines!

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 

Horizontal rule
