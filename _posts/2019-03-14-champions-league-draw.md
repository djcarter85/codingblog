# Champions League Quarter-Final Draw

Last night [Liverpool beat Bayern Munich 3-1](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47543631) in the Champions League Round of 16. This means that, of the eight teams left in the competition, exactly half are English ([for the first time since 2008-09](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1105950279642636294)).

This got me thinking. What is the probability of all the English teams avoiding each other in Friday's quarter-final draw?
