I recently came across [Command Line
Parser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline). It's a C# library
(available on NuGet) that takes care of the boilerplate code often associated
with parsing, validating and using options specified as command line arguments.

It uses common conventions for how it assumes the options will appear (similar
to C's `getopt` function).

The GitHub page has [pretty comprehensive
documentation](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline/wiki) on how to
use it, but I thought I'd share here briefly how it works.

## Simple options

Suppose we're creating an application which describes a file in terms of its
properties (size, file type etc), and suppose the desired command-line options
are:

- `<file path>` (required)
- `-d` or `--detailed` (if present gives as much information as it can find,
  otherwise gives the most commonly-wanted info)
- `-o <file path>` or `--output <file path>` (specifies a file to output the
  file properties to)

Then we create an `Options` class with properties for all the possible
command-line options, decorated with attributes detailing the expected usage:

##### C#

```cs
class Options
{
    [Value(0)]
    public string FilePath { get; set; }

    [Option('d', "detailed")]
    public bool Detailed { get; set; }

    [Option('o', "output")]
    public string Output { get; set; }
}
```

The `Value` attribute defines a positional argument, and the `Option` attribute
defines an argument that is passed in by name.

Then in the `Main` method, it's as simple as doing the following:

##### C#

```cs
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CommandLine.Parser.Default.ParseArguments<Options>(args)
            .WithParsed<Options>(o => {
                // parsing successful; go ahead and run the app
            })
            .WithNotParsed<Options>(e => {
                // parsing unsuccessful; deal with parsing errors
            });
    }
}
```

The `Options` object `o` will be populated with the parsed options, which you
can then use to control the behaviour of your app.

## Verbs

It also supports the idea of verbs. For example, Git has a number of different
actions you can take (`git clone`, `git commit`, `git pull` etc) which each have
their own sets of options.

With Command Line Parser, you create a separate options class for each verb:

##### C#

```cs
[Verb("clone")]
class CloneOptions {
    // ...
}

[Verb("commit")]
class CommitOptions {
    // ...
}

[Verb("pull")]
class PullOptions {
    // ...
}
```

And then in your `Main` method you define what to do for each verb, as well as
how to handle parsing errors:

##### C#

```cs
class Program
{
    static int Main(string[] args) 
    {
        return CommandLine.Parser.Default.ParseArguments<AddOptions, CommitOptions, CloneOptions>(args)
            .MapResult(
                (CloneOptions o) => { 
                    // clone
                },
                (CommitOptions o) => {
                    // commit
                },
                (PullOptions o) => {
                    // pull
                },
                e => 1);
    }
}
```

## Customisation

The examples I've given here use `CommandLine.Parser.Default`, but it's possible
to customise the parser in a number of different ways. For example, you can set
the culture for arguments to be parsed in, or whether to parse values
case-sensitively or not. 

## Help text

One of the really nice things about Command Line Parser is that it can generate
help text for your application. All you need to do is add the `HelpText`
property to the attributes, and then if someone passes in the `--help` switch
they'll get the full help text.

For example, our Options class from before could be changed to:

##### C#

```cs
class Options
{
    [Value(0, HelpText = "The file to display information for.")]
    public string FilePath { get; set; }

    [Option('d', "detailed", HelpText = "Whether to output detailed information about the file.")]
    public bool Detailed { get; set; }

    [Option('o', "output", HelpText = "If specified, a file to output the results to.")]
    public string Output { get; set; }
}
```

Then running the app with the `--help` switch gives us the following output:

##### Output

```
  -d, --detailed    Whether to output detailed information about the file.

  -o, --output      If specified, a file to output the results to.

  --help            Display this help screen.

  --version         Display version information.

  value pos. 0      The file to display information for.
```

This text is automatically output if parsing fails.

You can also add an overall summary for your application, along with some
examples of how to use it. These are added to the help screen.

## Conclusion

Command Line Parser takes away the boilerplate code associated with parsing
command-line options. I can see that this would be useful on a small app with a
couple of options right up to a hugely complex app with dozens of options.

I've recently used it on a football match simulation app, which may be the
subject of a future blog post ...
