      Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a software developer living in Cambridgeshire, UK. At
      work I'm typically using C# to create enterprise applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      My programming interests include C#/.NET, functional programming, web
      design, and the intersection of mathematics and programming; on this blog
      you'll find articles on a variety of topics. I started it to help me
      consolidate my thoughts on coding, and I hope that you'll find it useful
      too!
    </p>

    <p>
      The two most important things about me are that I'm a Christian and, since
      2023, a husband to Laura.
