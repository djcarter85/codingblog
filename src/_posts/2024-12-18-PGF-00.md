title: "ProcGen Fun 0: Introduction"
summary: Introductory post to a series combining procedural generation and functional programming.
---

Here begins a series of blog posts combining two concepts I've long since been
interested in: **procedural generation** and **functional programming**.

[Procedural generation
(procgen)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) is the technique
of creating data algorithmically instead of manually. It's typically powered by
randomness operating within certain constraints. This allows you to generate
many different instances of a structure which all follow a coherent pattern.

I'm utterly fascinated by the idea of giving a computer a set of rules and a
random number generator and it giving you something beautiful in return! For
example, the beautiful village map below was generated procedurally using [Oleg
Dolya's village generator](https://watabou.itch.io/village-generator). I love
seeing what people come up with on the [r/proceduralgeneration
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/).

[Functional programming
(FP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is a programming
paradigm which centres on the idea of composing functions. It's often considered
in contrast to _imperative programming_, where successive statements update the
state of the program. As much as possible, functions in FP should be _pure_,
meaning:

- A given set of inputs must always produce the same output (such functions are
  said to be _deterministic_).
- The function must not cause _side-effects_; that is, observable behaviour
  apart from the return value of the function. For example, a function should
  return values instead of modifying the inputs passed in (known as
  _immutability_).

In my experience, applying principles from functional programming tends to make
your code much easier to read and reason about. For example, avoiding
side-effects means that you can focus on just the inputs and outputs to a called
function.

At first glance it might seem odd to combine procedural generation and
functional programming. Randomness is an inherently impure concept; by
definition, you don't always get the same answer when you ask for a random
number! However, there are ways of expressing randomness in a functional
way (as we shall see), and I'm intrigued to see whether we're able to reap the
benefits of functional principles within an intrinsically random system.

In this series I'll be using C#. This might seem an odd choice, as F# is the
functional-first language within the .NET ecosystem. However, C# has embraced
many functional principles in recent years, and it's much more familiar to me
(and probably my readers). Perhaps a post later on in this series could explore
migrating the functional core to F#.

The source code for this series can be found [on
GitHub](https://github.com/djcarter85/ProcGenFun); each post will have its own
branch so you can follow along if you like.
