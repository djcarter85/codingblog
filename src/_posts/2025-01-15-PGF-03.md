So far in this series we have given ourseleves the ability to generate random
values corresponding to some distribution. In this post we're going to actually
start generating something pretty, namely some mazes!

Much of the next few posts takes inspiration from the book [Mazes for
Programmers](https://amzn.eu/d/2OqU3WZ) by [Jamis
Buck](https://weblog.jamisbuck.org/). It's well worth a read!

Since the last post in this series, I've put together a [playground
website](https://procgenfun.carterdan.net/) where you can run the algorithms for
yourself and see the results. This will be particularly fun to watch as we look
at procedural generation of mazes.

## Representing a maze in code

To start with, we need a grid to work on. A grid is made up of cells, which we
can partition into rows and columns.

![Maze with all walls](/assets/images/2025-01-15-PGF-03/maze-all-walls.svg)

We can refer to columns using an X coordinate and rows using a Y coordinate
(0-indexed, of course!). For example, the highlighted cell in the below image is
the cell with X=4 and Y=6.

![Maze grid](/assets/images/2025-01-15-PGF-03/grid.svg)

We can represent this in code with `Cell` and `Grid` types.

```cs
public record Cell(int X, int Y);

public class Grid
{
    public Grid(int width, int height)
    {
        this.Width = width;
        this.Height = height;
        this.Cells =
            (from y in Enumerable.Range(0, this.Height)
             from x in Enumerable.Range(0, this.Width)
             select new Cell(x, y))
             .ToList();
    }

    public int Width { get; }

    public int Height { get; }

    public IEnumerable<Cell> Cells { get; }
}
```

We also need to keep track of which walls are present between cells in any
particular maze. I've chosen to represent this using the four cardinal
directions on a map, but another approach could be to store a wall as the pair
of cells on either side of the wall.

```cs
public enum Direction { North, East, South, West }

public class Maze
{
    private readonly ImmutableDictionary<Cell, ImmutableList<Direction>> cellWalls;

    private Maze(
        Grid grid,
        ImmutableDictionary<Cell, ImmutableList<Direction>> cellWalls)
    {
        this.Grid = grid;
        this.cellWalls = cellWalls;
    }

    public Grid Grid { get; }

    public static Maze WithAllWalls(Grid grid)
    {
        var cellWalls = ImmutableDictionary<Cell, ImmutableList<Direction>>.Empty;

        foreach (var cell in grid.Cells)
        {
            cellWalls = cellWalls.Add(
                cell,
                [Direction.North, Direction.East, Direction.South, Direction.West]);
        }

        return new Maze(grid, cellWalls);
    }

    public bool WallExists(Cell cell, Direction direction) =>
        this.cellWalls[cell].Contains(direction);
}
```

Here I'm using a couple of types from the `System.Collections.Immutable`
namespace. The idea behind these is that instead of (say) adding a new value to
a list, you call a method which returns you a new list with that value added.

The `Maze` class works in the same way: you can't modify it, but you can call a
method to give you a new maze with one wall removed.

```cs
public Maze RemoveWall(Cell cell, Direction direction)
{
    var adjacentCell = this.Grid.AdjacentCellOrNull(cell, direction);

    if (adjacentCell == null)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            $"{direction} wall cannot be removed.");
    }

    return new Maze(
        this.Grid,
        this.cellWalls
            .SetItem(cell, this.cellWalls[cell].Remove(direction))
            .SetItem(
                adjacentCell,
                this.cellWalls[adjacentCell].Remove(direction.Opposite())));
}
```

To keep the set of walls consistent, we must remove the wall from the cells on
both side of the wall.

## The binary tree algorithm

Enough chat; you came here for mazes, so let's make one!

The _binary tree algorithm_ is probably the simplest maze generation algorithm.
For each cell in the grid, choose randomly between South and East, and remove
the wall in that direction. That's it!

If you try and implement this yourself, you'll notice that there are a few edge
cases (quite literally). Along the South edge, you can't remove the South wall
because it's the edge of the grid, so you only have one option: to remove the
East wall. Similarly, along the East edge, you can only remove the South wall.
You then ignore the South-East cell entirely, as there are no walls you can
remove.

Here's what you end up with!

![Maze generated using the binary tree
algorithm](/assets/images/2025-01-15-PGF-03/binary-tree.svg)

Notice the unbroken corridors along the South and East sides of the maze. The
binary tree algorithm unfortunately always generates mazes like this, but it's a
good first start as we explore maze generation. Later in the series we'll
generate mazes with less obvious biases.

## Binary tree algorithm in code

The code for this demonstrates really nicely the idea of composing distributions
to create new ones. All the functions shown below are entirely pure: they only
depend on their inputs and produce no side-effects. The final result is not a
maze, but a distribution _which when sampled_ produces a maze.

### Outline

```cs
public static IDistribution<Maze> MazeDist(Grid grid)
{
    IDistribution<Maze> mazeDist = InitialMazeDist(grid);

    foreach (var cell in grid.Cells)
    {
        mazeDist = mazeDist.SelectMany(m => NextStepDist(m, grid, cell));
    }

    return mazeDist;
}
```

Starting from an initial distribution, we loop through all the cells and update
the distribution based on the different (random) outcomes that could occur at
each step.

The use of `SelectMany()` here instead of `Select()` is crucial: it tells us
that for a given maze so far, there could (in general) be multiple different
ways for the maze to evolve. This corresponds with the fact that (in general)
there are multiple possibilities for which wall we choose to remove.

### Initial distribution

```cs
private static IDistribution<Maze> InitialMazeDist(Grid grid)
{
    var initialState = Maze.WithAllWalls(grid);

    return Singleton.New(initialState);
}
```

In future we'll see algorithms with a random initial state, but in this case
there is only one way to start the process. For this we use the singleton
distribution: a distribution which gives the same value every time it is
sampled.

### Updating the distribution

```cs
private static IDistribution<Maze> NextStepDist(Maze maze, Grid grid, Cell cell)
{
    var validDirections = GetValidDirections(cell, grid);

    if (UniformDistribution.TryCreate(validDirections, out var directionDist))
    {
        return directionDist.Select(dir => maze.RemoveWall(cell, dir));
    }
    else
    {
        return Singleton.New(maze);
    }
}

private static IEnumerable<Direction> GetValidDirections(Cell cell, Grid grid) =>
    new[] { Direction.South, Direction.East }.Where(dir => grid.CanRemoveWall(cell, dir));
```

The function above takes in a maze (the result so far) and returns a
distribution describing the possible ways a maze could look after randomly
removing the South or East wall. If it's possible to remove either (or both) of
them, then we choose between them randomly (represented as a distribution, of
course). If not, we leave the maze as-is.

## Visualising the algorithm at work

We now have the ability to generate a maze image.

![Maze generated using the binary tree
algorithm](/assets/images/2025-01-15-PGF-03/binary-tree.svg)

This is nice enough, but it would be even better to be able to see the algorithm
at work, and generate a series of images showing the algorithm as it loops
through the cells removing walls.

If we were coding this imperatively (as opposed to functionally), then we'd
probably loop through the cells and generate the maze image at each step.
However, because we're not allowing ourselves to sample any random values within
the functional core, we can't do this.

If you're not used to coding functionally then this sort of problem can seem
quite daunting. The solution (as is often the case) is to take a step back. What
random value do we actually want? Or, put another way, for which type `T` do we
want an `IDistribution<T>`?

We currently have a function returning an `IDistribution<Maze>`; that is, a
random maze. In order to visualise the process we need not a random _maze_, but
the random _series of steps_ which got us there.

So, let's introduce a new type which can be used as the `T` in our
`IDistribution<T>`. We need to store not just the current maze, but also the
steps we took to get there.

```cs
record BinaryTreeState(
    Maze Initial, ImmutableList<BinaryTreeStep> Steps, Maze Current);

record BinaryTreeStep(Cell Cell, Maze Maze);
```

We then need to make a few changes to our algorithm. The code remains unchanged
for both the initial distribution and how to move from one step to the next, but
some changes are needed to the top-level function to compose the distributions
differently.

```cs
private static IDistribution<BinaryTreeState> StateDist(Grid grid)
{
    var stateDist =
        from maze in InitialMazeDist(grid)
        select new BinaryTreeState(Initial: maze, Steps: [], Current: maze);

    foreach (var cell in grid.Cells)
    {
        stateDist = stateDist.SelectMany(state =>
            from maze in NextStepDist(state.Current, grid, cell)
            select state with
            {
                Steps = state.Steps.Add(new BinaryTreeStep(cell, maze)),
                Current = maze
            });
    }

    return stateDist;
}
```

The key difference here is within the loop. Once we've got the next step we
don't just update the current value; we also add it (with the cell we've just
processed) to the history.

Notice how immutability is really helping us here. If we were modifying the maze
as we go then we wouldn't be able to keep track of the history, as the previous
state would be lost.

If we sample from this distribution and generate a series of images (one for
each step), we can turn them into an animation showing how we made our maze.

![Animation showing the steps involved in generating a maze using the binary
tree algorithm](/assets/images/2025-01-15-PGF-03/maze-animation.gif)

I don't know about you, but I could sit watching this for hours!

## Conclusion

The binary tree algorithm is very easy to implement, but the mazes it generates
are noticeably lop-sided. After a [few](/2025/08/07/birthdays)
[short](/2025/08/25/birthdays-revisited) [detours](/2025/09/04/PGF-04), we'll
implement an algorithm with less bias.
