Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„

To start off, I've created a Visual Studio solution and two C# projects:

- [ProcGenFun](https://github.com/djcarter85/ProcGenFun/tree/post-01/ProcGenFun)
  will contain the core code and will strictly follow functional programming
  principles.
- [ProcGenFun.WinForms](https://github.com/djcarter85/ProcGenFun/tree/post-01/ProcGenFun.WinForms)
  is a Windows Forms application which will enable us to visualise the results
  of our functional core. This project will contain some imperative code.

## Distributions

In [a previous post on this blog](/2019/07/10/champions-league-draw-revisited/)
I introduced the concept of a _distribution_: a source of random values of a
given type corresponding to some probability distribution. This
abstraction is useful for expressing stochastic (i.e. non-deterministic)
algorithms in a functional way.

```cs
public interface IDistribution<T>
{
    T Sample();
}
```

In this series I'll be using the NuGet package [RandN](https://randn.dev/),
which declares a variant of this interface:

```cs
public interface IDistribution<T>
{
    T Sample<TRng>(TRng rng);
}
```

The difference here is the presence of a random number generator (RNG), which is
passed into the `Sample()` method. This is actually quite useful for maintaining
functional purity, because we can make sure that we never create an RNG within
the functional core; instead it will be created in the impure WinForms project
and passed in where needed.

(Aside: there's also a `TrySample()` method on this interface, which we will be
largely ignoring during this series.)

## Example

RandN comes with a handful of built-in distributions. A simple example is the
uniform distribution; calling `Uniform.New(0d, 1d)` gives us a uniform
distribution of `double`s between 0 and 1.

Given a collection of samples from a distribution, we can make a histogram; this
calculation is functional, so can go in the core project.

```cs
public static Histogram New(IEnumerable<double> values, double min, double max)
{
    const int bucketCount = 100;
    var buckets = new int[bucketCount];

    foreach (var value in values)
    {
        var bucketIndex = (int)(bucketCount * (value - min) / (max - min));
        if (0 <= bucketIndex && bucketIndex < bucketCount)
        {
            buckets[bucketIndex]++;
        }
    }

    var bucketWidth = (max - min) / bucketCount;

    return new Histogram(
        buckets
            .Select((count, index) => new HistogramBucket(
                Centre: min + bucketWidth * (index + 0.5),
                Count: count))
            .ToList(),
        bucketWidth);
}
```

Then in the WinForms project we can take a large number of samples, generate a
histogram, and plot it.

```cs
private void DisplayHistogram()
{
    var rng = StandardRng.Create();
    var dist = Uniform.New(0d, 1d);

    var values = TakeSamples(dist, count: 100_000, rng);

    DisplayHistogram(values);
}

private static IEnumerable<T> TakeSamples<T, TRng>(
    IDistribution<T> dist, int count, TRng rng)
    where TRng : notnull, IRng
{
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
    {
        yield return dist.Sample(rng);
    }
}

private void DisplayHistogram(IEnumerable<double> values)
{
    var histogram = Histogram.New(values, min: 0, max: 1);

    formsPlot.Reset();
    var barPlot = formsPlot.Plot.Add.Bars(
        histogram.Buckets.Select(b => b.Centre),
        histogram.Buckets.Select(b => b.Count));

    foreach (var bar in barPlot.Bars)
    {
        bar.Size = histogram.BucketWidth;
    }

    formsPlot.Refresh();
}
```

(I'm using another NuGet package, [ScottPlot](https://scottplot.net/), to
visualise the results.)

distribution](/assets/images/2024-12-25-PGF-01/uniform.png)

As you can see, we've got a broadly uniform spread of values between 0 and 1.

## Conclusion

So far we've introduced an abstraction for randomness called a _distribution_. In
post 2 we'll see how this abstraction allows us to compose random variables in a
very functional way.
