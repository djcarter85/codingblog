  <p class="mb-6 text-3xl italic text-gray-500">Introductory post to a series combining procedural generation and functional programming.</p>

  <article class="prose"><p>Here begins a series of blog posts combining two concepts I've long since been
interested in: <strong>procedural generation</strong> and <strong>functional programming</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">Procedural generation
(procgen)</a> is the technique
of creating data algorithmically instead of manually. It's typically powered by
randomness operating within certain constraints. This allows you to generate
many different instances of a structure which all follow a coherent pattern.</p>
<p>I'm utterly fascinated by the idea of giving a computer a set of rules and a
random number generator and it giving you something beautiful in return! For
example, the beautiful village map below was generated procedurally using <a href="https://watabou.itch.io/village-generator">Oleg
Dolya's village generator</a>. I love
seeing what people come up with on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/">r/proceduralgeneration
subreddit</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024-12-18-PGF-00/village.png" alt="Procedurally generated village"></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional programming
(FP)</a> is a programming
paradigm which centres on the idea of composing functions. It's often considered
in contrast to <em>imperative programming</em>, where successive statements update the
state of the program. As much as possible, functions in FP should be <em>pure</em>,
meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A given set of inputs must always produce the same output (such functions are
said to be <em>deterministic</em>).</li>
<li>The function must not cause <em>side-effects</em>; that is, observable behaviour
apart from the return value of the function. For example, a function should
return values instead of modifying the inputs passed in (known as
<em>immutability</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, applying principles from functional programming tends to make
your code much easier to read and reason about. For example, avoiding
side-effects means that you can focus on just the inputs and outputs to a called
function.</p>
<p>At first glance it might seem odd to combine procedural generation and
functional programming. Randomness is an inherently impure concept; by
definition, you don't always get the same answer when you ask for a random
number! However, there are ways of expressing randomness in a functional
way (as we shall see), and I'm intrigued to see whether we're able to reap the
benefits of functional principles within an intrinsically random system.</p>
<p>In this series I'll be using C#. This might seem an odd choice, as F# is the
functional-first language within the .NET ecosystem. However, C# has embraced
many functional principles in recent years, and it's much more familiar to me
(and probably my readers). Perhaps a post later on in this series could explore
migrating the functional core to F#.</p>
<p>The source code for this series can be found <a href="https://github.com/djcarter85/ProcGenFun">on
GitHub</a>; each post will have its own
branch so you can follow along if you like.</p>
